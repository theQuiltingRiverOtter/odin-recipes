            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine the water, sugar and kosher salt in the bowl of a stand mixer and sprinkle the yeast on top.
                    Allow
                    to sit for 5 minutes or until the mixture begins to foam. Add the flour and butter and, using the
                    dough
                    hook
                    attachment, mix on low speed until well combined. Change to medium speed and knead until the dough
                    is
                    smooth
                    and pulls away from the side of the bowl, approximately 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the dough from the
                    bowl,
                    clean the bowl and then oil it well with vegetable oil. Return the dough to the bowl, cover with
                    plastic
                    wrap and sit in a warm place for approximately 50 to 55 minutes or until the dough has doubled in
                    size.
                </li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Line 2 half-sheet pans with parchment paper and lightly brush
                    with
                    the
                    vegetable oil. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Bring the 10 cups of water and the baking soda to a rolling boil in an 8-quart saucepan or roasting
                    pan.
                </li>
                <li>In the meantime, turn the dough out onto a slightly oiled work surface and divide into 8 equal
                    pieces.
                    Roll
                    out each piece of dough into a 24-inch rope. Make a U-shape with the rope, holding the ends of the
                    rope,
                    cross them over each other and press onto the bottom of the U in order to form the shape of a
                    pretzel.
                    Place
                    onto the parchment-lined half sheet pan.</li>
                <li>Place the pretzels into the boiling water, 1 by 1, for 30 seconds. Remove them from the water using
                    a
                    large
                    flat spatula. Return to the half sheet pan, and sprinkle with the pretzel salt. Bake until dark
                    golden
                    brown
                    in color, approximately 12 to 14
                    minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack for at least 5 minutes before serving.</li>
